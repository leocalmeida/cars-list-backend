# Laborit's Backend Developer Test

In this project was proposed the creation of a Restful API.
The requirements could be checked on the following link: [Laborit Test](https://gitlab.com/snippets/1891831).

My version of this Restful API was built with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/#/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).
